# Categories

Categories in Mosets Tree are the primary way to structure your directory in Mosets Tree. Categories are among the first thing your users will see when they visit your directory. They also dictate how search engine friendly (SEF) URLs are generated for your listings.

Categories can be added to your directory in a few ways. You can them through Mosets Tree back-end interface or you can allow your users to add them in front-end.

## Top Level Categories

Top level categories are the first level of categories in your directory. They have the additional capability called Category Configuration. Category Configuration lets you override [Mosets Tree configuration]({{version}}/configuration) that will only affects this category and its sub-categories.

For example, you can disable reviews in a top level categories while they are accepted in other categories. Or you can show User Profile in a top level category while they are not shown in others.

Top Level Categories and Category Configuration are part of the system that make the [Multi Directory]({{version}}/multi-directory) support possible.
