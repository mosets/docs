# Templates

Mosets Tree comes with a default Kinabalu template with up to [7 listing details style](http://www.mosets.com/tree/templates/) and various configurable options to customize the template. This template supports additional module positions within the Mosets Tree extension. These module positions are available in index and category pages, opening up the possibilities of showing additional information in these pages. 

For every update in Mosets Tree, Kinabalu template will be overridden by a new version. If you need more customizability, make a copy of the default template and make changes to your new template. All this can be done through Mosets Tree's back-end. In the "_Templates_" function, make a copy of the Kinabalu template, name it different and fill in a folder name. Now you can start to customize your own directory's layout and set it as default for your site. Therefore, Mosets Tree's update will affect the entire directory except your custom template.

Categories and Listings in Mosets Tree can be configured to use any template. So, it is possible for you to customize distinct template for specific Category or Listing page of your site. 

Kinabalu template is highly customizable and suitable for use in any type of directories. It is easy and flexible to modify the templates without touching the core codes. If you're feeling creative, customize the template!
